This repository contains browser bookmarklets I created using Javascript that I use daily to instantly navigate to frequently used URLs that contain variable parameters. No rocket science. Just some simple productivity hacks that help me being a quick tester.

# Ok, what are browser bookmarklets in the first place?
A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. Bookmarklets are unobtrusive JavaScripts stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually JavaScript programs. - Source: [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)

# How are browser bookmarklets useful for testers?
Testers use a lot of tools on the web in their daily work routine (For example: Google, Stackoverflow, JIRA, Selenium Documentation, any other project specific internal tools). Context switching leads us to frequently moving from one website/web tool to the other. Quite often the pages (URLs) that we navigate to change based on certain parameters for example we google a different query.
